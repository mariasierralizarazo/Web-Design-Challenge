# Web-Design-Challenge
HTML site creation based on provided data and images
<br></br>
Used tools:
<li><strong>Bootstrap:</strong> as Front end Framework </li>
<li><strong>Pandas:</strong> for generating HTML code of a large dataset as a table </li>
<br></br>
Nowadays, reading data is better with all the available visualization tools. Graphical visualizations allow people to have a better understanding of what datasets are representing or the goal of analyzing them; also, as it is well known: " A picture is worth a thousand words."
In this project, the main goal was to build a website where the results of analyzing a weather dataset were posted with the corresponding explanations. All the data and images were given for focusing the project on the construction of the website. <br></br>
The initial graphs from the analysis are in the <a href="https://github.com/mariasierralizarazo/Web-Design-Challenge/tree/master/WebVisualizations/assets/images">[assets/images]</a> folder, and the original data is in the <a href="https://github.com/mariasierralizarazo/Web-Design-Challenge/blob/master/WebVisualizations/Resources/cities.csv">[Resources/cities.csv]</a> file.
